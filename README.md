# Random-Mods
This mod folder is a compilation of the various small modlets I've created due to various reasons. They should be compatible with each other but you'll probably get the most of it if you choose the modifications you want inside the files. I've tried to make it clear which parts are for which features so clipping and adding it to your own files should be easy. If the header has a name in uppercase letters, it means there are other snippets of code in other files that are required for it to work. These specific files are defined next to the name.

This mod compilation will most likely be useful if you are looking on examples of how to do some modifications similar to a one listed above. In actual gameplay some changes may prove useful whereas other are either indifferent (SWAT helmet mod) or even negative (Haybale mines). However, if you want to make your life more chaotic, go for it! It's all there for you to use freely.
